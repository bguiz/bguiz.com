## people, not users

- rachel binx

- co-founder of vine initially disallowed the front facing camera, because he didn't want it to be "polluted" with selfies
- spectrum of proscription about how you should behave on social networks
	- facebook and google plus: explicitly state and have rules that enforce that you use your real identity
	- twitter and tumble: nhardly any proscription, maximum allowed anonimity
- the kind of content that you ar producing in a long-form post is very different from a short-form one
	- long form posts are usually for a public audience, people that you don't see very often
	- short form posts are for people you interact with day to day
		- akin to hanging out with your friends
		- tranlsating your IRL experiences to social networks, and we're still figuring out how to do this
		- technology makes thi more feasible: accesible everywhere, and much higher bandwidth
- social networks are like 3rd places:
	- 1st: home
	- 2nd; work/ school
	- 3rd: in betweens: cooffe shops, community centres, bars
		- where you can hang out with your firends, but also 
		- the designers an d creators of these places need to let go of control, and let the users figure out what they wanna use this
		- the most successful social networks are tghe ones that listen to these user wants, and enhance those experiences
			- e.g. twitter making retweets a thing

##  plug

- adobe is a premier sponsor app to behave like
	- competition where you create something cool with animated text
	- giving away a pair of converse shoes (limited edition)
	- yield
		- renee lance
		- code edit has inline CSS & theseus plugins
			- plugins are part of the brackets framework, and everything is written in HTML5
- silver stripe is running a scavenger hunt
- telerik (creators of kendoUI)
	- john bristow - archetypal of animated gifs
- DT digital
	- interactive things with IRL and digital
	- show case the fantastic work thet we do in australia
- campaign monitor
	- giving away a backpack full of geek goodies
	- 
- braintree
	- payments provider with a developer friendly API
	- t-shirts
- small multiples
	- yield
		- rolled own custom backbone framework, called BAM - declarative syntax, manages views using a FSM, views are aware of their own hierarchy
			- bockit/bam
- break!

## Conquering the uncanny valley

- andrew betts
- @triblondon
- making web apps

### what makes it

- each frame needs to render in less than 16ms
- no pause longer than 100ms
	- anything faster than this will appear instantaneous
- matchign expectations
	- of what your user expects the app to behave
	- make experiences as intuitive as possible

### Network

- hit the networks as infrequently as possible
	- load everything asynchronously - dere and asynce
- start loading scripts afetr onlad
	- even async can block
- sprite images and concatenate scripts

- see power consumption of the radio antenna of the mobile device
- latency by radio state
	- the longer the delay between network polls is, the larger the larger the latency
		- radio takes time to warm up
		- so minimise the multiple requests
	- batch requests
		- do this aggressively
		- collect requests asynchronously
		- add actions to an API queue
		- process queues in the background
			- and then unbatch them, and call the original callbacks
		- !!! idea for qryq!
	- http 2.0 aka SPDY
		- makes this unnessecary
		- cannot optimise requests that you need to load from a different domain, analytics scripts
			- also see w3c beacon API
- images
	- 50%-70% of all network traffic
	- use an accessible responsive images technique
	- use a single high resolution image with high compression
- 3rd party scripts
	- one of the biggest consumers of networks traffic, and polling timers
		- especially with analytics
	- always test your site before and after loading the analytics scripts
	- ask the right questions before you add the scripts
		- make sure you raise the issue with marketing/ BAs

### prefetch

- you can do this at multiple levels of the page load
- 4 stages
	- resolve
	- connect
	- request
	- response
- you can actually jump the queue using
	- pre-resolve DNS host names for assets which you know that you will needs
	- fecth resources early
	- pre-render pages that you are sure that the user is going to go to

### rendering

- layout, paint, animations, 'jank'
- use the tools
	- timeline
		- used flexbox to system, but found it was really slow
		- using timeline to see how long each layout takes to render
		- this problem was fixed using new
	- hover effects
		- disable them when you do not need them
		- especially when scrolling
			- find a way to disable scroll effects while scrolling
			- put a hoverable class on the body whenever not scrolling
			- replace hover pseudoclasses with own custom hoverable class
	- frame rates
		- activate the meter in chrome flags
			- found out that border radius was the problem
		- layout boundary
			- the extent to which the browser needs to layout the whole DOM
				- need to minimise this
				- tell the browser that only this restricted part of the page needs to be done
			- !!! find out how to do this
				- boundarize by paul lewis - 
		- layout trashing
			- make more DOM operations than necessary
			- browsers are smart enough to batch them for you
				- but you force it to perform the operation every time you do a read
				- so instead alternative gets and sets, do all the gets at once, and then do all the sets at once
				- effect is very marked
		- asynchronous DOM
			- use wilson's fastDOM library
			- accomplishes this automatically using requestANimationFrame
				- around an order of magnitude faster
	- images
		- image decoding is probably the most expensive task you need a browser to do
		- a very image heavy page can make it very
			- don't download the imsages until the images are scrolled itno viewq
				- bad idea, because of temperamental
			- download all images as base64 encoded string
				- when scroll occurs, just put the string into the img src attributes
		- hardware accelerate transforms
			- uses gpu for
				- move, scale, filter, rotate
			- how to turn it on
				- translate Z in webkit (moves element to the GPU layer)

### stroing data

- family of technologies
	- cookies (grandad)
	- localStorage (dad)
	- IndexedDB (mum)
	- AppCache (Tenn)
	- Files API (Imaginary Friend)
	- what do you use these for?
		- matcht he staorage backend to what you wish to do
- localStorage vs IndexedDB
	- localstoagre is slow
- app cahce
	- it is being replaced, and is very hard anyway, and is a moving target
- ServiceWorker
	- acts as a web server within the browser

### storage optimisations

- html5 is constrained by the sandbx of the browser in terms of space
- JS uses UTF16 for text encoding
	- but very wasteful of bits
	- squeeze bits into 1 byte per character
		- pack ascii into UTF16
		- very quick and easy 

### click delay

- one of the easietc things to fix
	- apple's fault for introducing the delay for enabling double tap
	- 300ms causes people to think web apps are slow
- use fastclick
	- github.com/ftlabs/fastclick
	- very simple to do, but there are many edge cases for 

### it is all about perception

- make users think that it is faster even when it really isn't
- progress indicators
	- moves at the same rate
	- but animations within the bar
		- different animations for fast slow, and stopped
	- add a simple button to "refresh" the ajax request
		- liken this to the clsoe button in a lift
		- but it actually works
	- communicate not just the data, but the spirit of what you are trying to do

## satisfying movements

- john allsop

### history

### css transitions

- tell the browser, whenever this property changes, animate this change, and do it over this duration
	- transition-property
	- also works when you trigger the change using JS
		- even when user resizes the page, etc
- common pattern
	- accordion
		- height of 0 in colapsed state and height of X in its expenaded state
		- we want it to slide/ animate
			transition: height 1s;
		- lesson:
			- not every property can be animated
				- makes sense, e.g. boolean state, enumerated state
				- some kinds of value are animatable
					- e.g. auto to px cannot be animated for height
					-70- this in particular gets everyone the first time
					- use max-height instead of height
		- common design patterns
- you can also tell the browser to delay these transitions
	- same animation applies to all (e.g. element sin a list)
		- but apply a different delay to each one
	- this is called 2ndary effects
- linear timing is really boring
	- you can the browser easing or cushing through transition-timing-function
	- you can define them using QB bezier curves (spelling)
		- qbbezier.com
	- skeuomorphism is essential to designing UI/ UX
		- add cues from the real world into
		- but uncanny avlley, so don't get too caught up in the math
- browser support
	- pretty damn good
	- you need the webkit- prefix in older browsers
	- don't invest any effort in falling back
		- progressive enhancment

### limitations

- - only apply when properties are changed elsewhere in the CSS
- 2 key frames
	- only run in between them
	- must be define inidivudally for each statement
		- addresed using @keyframe
			- multi-step animations
- animations
	- step 1
		- specify animation using @ keyframe tule
	- step 2
		- apply the animation to aelemnts inthe DOM
- e.g. PULSING INPUT TEXT BOX WHEN IT IS SELECTED
	- @rules is similar to @media
	- give it a name
	- specify each of the steps of the animation
		- what are the key frames
		- what are the tweens between them

	@keyframe pulse {
		0% {
			box-shadow: 0 0 0 yellow;
		}
		100% {
			box-shadowL 0 0 12px yellow;
		}
	}

	- then attach it to an object

	input:focus {
		animation-name: pulse;
		animation-duration: 0.7x;
	}

	- by default this is only performed once, and then immdieately goes back to what it was before

	input:focus {
		animation-name: pulse;
		animation-duration: 0.7x;
		animation-iteration-count: inifinte; // or any +ve integer
	}

	- but now it jumps back immediately instead of going back and forth

	input:focus {
		animation-name: pulse;
		animation-duration: 0.7x;
		animation-iteration-count: 5;
		animation-direction: alternate;
	}

	- keep in mind that the each alternate cycle is the to

	input:focus {
		animation-name: pulse;
		animation-duration: 0.7x;
		animation-iteration-count: 5;
		animation-direction: alternate;
		animation-fill-mode: forwards; //tell it not to jump back to original state, but instead just stay where it is
	}

- non-sucky web development
	- if you can do anything in HTML & CSS don't use anything else
		- never use jQuery
	- try dto do everything declaratively if possible
- build a carousel using

	section.carousel

	- !!! make the itunes carousel
	- !!! find this in his slides
- what is happening under the hood
	- whle an animation is taking place, the DOM is constantly changging
	- but we aren't using blocking JS
	- still can cause a performance hit
		- use transforms to overcome them
		- transofrms allow us to take any element withint he page and move X&Y, rotate, or zoom
	- properties
		- 2D functions
			- translateX, translateY, rotate, resize
		- 3D functions
			- translateZ, roatteZ
		- translate 2D functions are with respect to the top-left corner of the element
		- instead of specifying keyframes using left or top, use trnslateX and translateY instead
			- 2 order of magintude better performance (a 50th as many reflows & layouts, etc)
		- scale instead of width and height
		- !!! find out if we can get this
- antic
	- setup for the action gonna happen
		- e.g. dialog that scales to 1.1 before scaling to zero
		- keyframes vanish
	- transform-origin
		- affects where the 2D operations happen
- 3d operations
	- Z axis comes out of the page
	- rotateX, rotateY make a sort of 3D
	- perspective
		- the lower the number, the closer you are
- what is the place of 3D & animation
	- use 3D space, and time to fit more into smaller devices
	- give users a sense of whether things are closer or further from each other
	- note that the rortations and tranlsation are applied in turn, on their current origin and normal (is the Z-axis)
		- use perspective and perspective origin to place the camera in the worls that we have created
	- the 3rd dimensionles us place more info in the same screen real estate

- haven't covered
	- timing functions
		- each keyframe can have its own
		- animation 101: create a bouncing ball
	- can bind events to certain points in animation
	- weired relationship between positions, Z-index, transfrmations
	- understand the impact on performance

## CORS and Javascript

- Michael Neale @michaelneale

- remove need for middleware servers
	- a proxy server for all that stuff
	= bad
- JSONP
	- add padding
	- way to get around CORS
	- most elegant hack ever
	- what it is really doing, is creating script tags, and does eval
	- problems
		- eval - so security problem
		- only can use HTTP GET (not other verbs)
- CORS
	- cross origin resource sharing
	- no eval
	- all HTTP verbs available
	- triivial to consume
	- http://enable-cors.org
- client sides
	- $.ajax must use with credntials
	- pre-light checks using HTTP OPTIONS
	- Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
		- this means any site can access - bad!
	- Access-Control-Allow-Origin: ${origin-from-request}
		- of course filter thi against whitelist or blacklist
- debugging
	- chrome://
	- need to turn it on otherwise you'll see it failing

## functional js

- dhanji prasanna @dhanji
- functional js as opposed to functioning js

### paradigms

- imperative (aka procedural)
	- C
- OO
	- smalltalk
- functional
	- haskell
- logic
	- prolog

- java & javascript
	- OO + imperative
- scala
	- imperative + functional

- FP 
	- group of idioms that comprises of composable functions
	- builds up in a modular programming
		- much simpler because each module is a function
	- declarative
		- describing what should happen rather than ho it should happen
		- avoids mutation: never change a value in place
	- makes it easy to reason about a really large code base
		- when there's a lot of different people working on the same code base
- stay away from
	- mutation
	- side effects
		- anything that happens that isn't directly related to the input
		- .e.g printing to screen
		- not avoiding them, but reathr puting them in very strict boxes
- spreadsheets
	- excel is the first large scale proponent of functinal programming
		- sum changes whenver any of the cells in the column changes
	- how do we take these ideas from s[readsheets, and put them into our js
- map
	- cherries = Map(pastries, function(p) { return p.cherry; })
	- no side effects
- filtering
	- d
- composition
	- pastries.select(..).map(..).reduce(...)
- currying
	- rethink a multi-argument function as a composition of multiple functions that each take a single argument
- monads
	- very scary sounding concept that largely came from math --> haskell --> larger programming
	- think of them as a box
		- a variable that is a value
		- a monad has a variable in it
		- schroedinger;s cat concept
	- useful in this scenario
		- check for is null guard
		- if everyone has to o this, it is a leaky abstraction
	- maybe mond
		- var maybeCat = Maybe(findCat());
		- maybeCat.map(function(a) {a.pat();});
		- can compose
		- it isolates all of these conditions into a box
		- composable to form pipelines
	- types
		- maybe: none, just(x)
		- either: left, right
		- reader
		- writer
		- state
- monads
	- giant system of composable boxes

- learning
	- underscoreJS
	- osteele.com/resources/javascript/functional
	- wikipedia for functional programming

## modularity matters

- anna gerber @annagerber

### spaghetti

- dealing with it
	- namespacing
	- testability
	- separation of concerns
	- maintainability
	- reduce complexity
	- flexible compositon
	- reuse
- but S doesn't have native support for these

### patterns

- pollution the global namespace
	- reduce
		- first thing to try is to us object literals
			- use convention like _ as prefix for private variables
		- next thing to try is the module patern
			- simulate pubic and private visibility
			- immdiately invoke thme
		- alternate:
			- build up the this object and return them
		- revealing module pattern
			- return just the ones that you want
		- limitations
			- privileged function
			- if you wanna extend (subclass) it bcomes tricky
		- privilege functions
			- use getters and setters
			- but still can be tightly coupled
		- mediator pattern
			- one module never talks directly to another, they simply use publish-subscribe
		- faacde pattern
			- provide secruity: filtering which modules can do what, translatione, etc.

## patterns alone are not enough - frameworks

- how do people use them?
- commonJS
	- try to sytandardise them:
	- what is used in nodeJS, and browserify
	- but it is synchronous, so it doesn't work very well
	- AMD split off from it
		- asynchronous
		- requireJS is the main implementation (similar to what angular uses)
	- UMD
		- make things work in both COmmonJS and AMD
		- way to writ modules that work with both node and requireJS
		- but can be very complex

### fragmentation

- there is quite a bit of it going on within the community 

### the future

- ES6 has modules as a language feature
- can already use them using transpilers:
	- traceur (google)
	- and some polyfills
	- but standards are not set, and are likely to change

## flex box

- ryan seddon

### css is awesome

- was originally design for document styling, not layouts

### flexbox

- flexible
- crazy good layout
- hard things are super easy
- RWD without even trying
	- responsive web design

### demo

.myFlex {
	display: flex;
	flex-wrap: wrap;
	flex-direction: row; //or column, row-reverse
	flex-flow: row wrap; // shorthand for direction and wrap
}

.myFlexItem {
	flex-grow: 1; //fills
	flex-shrink; // how many units can you shrink; less useful when wrap is turned on
	flex-basis: 200px; //think of it as min-width
	flex: 1 0 200px; //shorthan
}

### but there are 3 implementations

- came out in 2009
- the new CR will not change
- need webkit- prefix, et al.
- for i.e. you need tweener
- firefox doesn't support flex wrap

### protip

- use modernizr to know which version you are working with
- use a pre-processor like SAS or auto-prefixer to do prefixing

### real world

		display: flex;
		align-items: center;
		justify-content: center;

- pricing table
- holy grail layout
	- started in the alistapart site
	- order property to change its order is display without changing the order in the DOM

### hard to remember all the properties

### protip 2

- flexbox lends itself to small modules
- not full page layouts
- still use floats, inline-block where it makes sense

## the web - a less blocky place

- jared wyles
- adobe senior computer scientist

### content on the web


### css regions

- a new technology by adobe
- 2 props
	- flow-into
	- flow-from
- document.getNamesFlows()['beer'] //name that you passed into flow-into
- currently avilable is some of the newer browser + a ployfill in modernizr
- -webkit-shape-inside\
	- wrap text inside miscellaneous polygons
	- can even make cricles using many triangles
- spec has reached the final stages of w3c
- see adobe's alice in wonderland demo

- 1532 incans vs spanish conquistadors
	- dems the power of culture
	- nothign that separates us form the incans, if we avoid wanting to change the status quo
	- larry wall was the first guys to talk about the culture of programming
		- he thought about what sort of culture he wanted around the laguage when he designed perl
		- wanted eclectic people
- thinsk that tech cultures is lame now
	- wants to change it
	- more people could be doing more cool stuff
	- more distributed
- barely succeeding
	- willing to work and and follow your dreams, you will find your mildest dreams
	- startup culture is rotten from the inside
		- outdated
- what is success
	- not just money, especially in tech
	- cornelius vanderbilt - the build an empire idea
	- very easy to go through a rich fulfillin career wrting software, but never have done anything that let any mark
- standard model of startups
	- liek the standard model of physics
	- ignores 96$% of reality
	- been changing alot and has reached the 'decadent stage'
	- the model started of as very simple
		- now has become increasing complex and absrtact
		- has lost touch with reality somewhat
	- venture capital seekers are no longer capitalists
		- they do not compete on the free market
		- they compete for VC metrics
			- more akin to central planning in communist economies
- how do customers and companies interact with each other
	- traingular relationship between companies, investors, and users
	- throw advertisers into the mix
- only favours one half of the couple
	- the steve jobses get rewarded
	- the steve wozniaks get screwed
	- fund raising and team building consumes all of you time, and you no longer get to do the things that you fancy
- the only thing that is still cheap in silicon valley is labour
	- everythign else is still cheap
	- so they always go for young males
	- women get discriminated against - poisonous for women
- the startup indisustry is the same as the record industry
	- fund a lot of artists, and hope that one isn a 1000 of them will be a mega hit

- the lifestyle business
	- that's what a startup is
- not every business has to be an empire
	- you can make something small and cool, and be proud of it
- compete against big companies
	- even big comapnies only have small teams for any of their projects
	- people will be happy to pay money of they want to see you in business for longer
- the internet is going to be around for a long time

### beyond mobile, beyond web

- scott jensen @scottjensen

### UIs good and bad

- great UI examples is when it is seamless
	-

### sociolology of design

- we look to the past, and see what is easy to extrapolate, and that is what we predict the future or technology with
- what coyuld we actually do, instead?
- the future that we evisioned

- it took us more than 20 years to 
- the structure of scientific revolution by thomas s kleun
	- don't read it, the wikipedia page is more than adequate
	- kutin cycle
		- what is fascinating is what causes the revoluton: a s small minority
			- e.g. galileo - he vast majority of people try to resist the change
	- default thinking - his own book
		- when we see a new technology, we don't use it for what it is intended for, but what rather do yesterdauy's asks with it
			- e.g. TV, first show were radio plays read out in front of the camera
		- perspective is worth 80 IQ points - alan kay
	- everybody wants innovation, but nobody wants risk
		- come up with a lot of ideas, and then never execute them
		- most people get stuck in the model revolution
	- the smart fridge
		- clasic example
		- wired magazine: welcome to the programmable world
			- this articl does us disservice, it sets us back
			- technologist think is terms of trigger rules
			- person and a device
				- same pattern for a long time: we have a device, and we install apps on them
				- now we add a third thing: the cloud provider
					- the cloud is constantly changing and evolving
					- but out default thinking is still the same: person and device
	- mistake:
		- smart devices need to be baely smart
		- 3 default categories
			- dscovery
				- just broadcast a URL to them
				- when you visit the URL, you go to the website for them
				- e.g. a toaster: put in the model number, and the serial number, and you get all the information about it (manuals, etc,) and crowdsourced information about it
			- control
				- be able to control it via a website
				- do trivial things with it for a trivial set of functions
			- coordination
				- where we are trying to make things happen with multiple devices all synchronizing
	- a 2x2 matrix
		- X axis: direct || background
		- Y axis: device || swarm
		- direct && device
			- thi is the classic thing
			- all the iStuff
		- direct swarm
			- one interaction, multiple devices
			- e.g.
				- smart light bulbs
				- parking lots telling you which levels and lots are full
				- iBeacon on bluetooth 4
		- background device
			- e.g.
				- lockitron - electronic door unlocking device
			- once you get it set up, you don't have to bother with it
		- background swarm
			- e.g.  mutliple sensors for smart lightbulbs within the house
		- trend
			- more background an more swarm
			- but background + swarm - we'll get there more slowly
				- what will most likely happen first, is that we will have the smart background do stuff that is default, n then offer the options for the more tricky decisions
		- 
	- just in time interaction
		- not a new app for everything
			- why mobile apps must die
				- too many apps can be overwhelming
				- value > pain
				- but the focus is too much on increasing value, and too little on decreasing pain
	- classic problem
		- yahoo vs gogle
			- indexing --> ranking
	- the web
		- most amazing rendering engine
		- but still a URL bar at the top - ugly CLI interface
		- instead of having an app for everything
			- just scan all the msart objects in the vicinity, and bring up a contextual list of things that should be done
				- the next google
				- the just-in-time ecosystem
					- where evey pysical device is a website
		- the stormy sky of cranky clouds
			- there is no louds, there are multiple clouds that don't like each other
			- all of them don't talk to each other
			- all the compnaies want to keep their data an apis within a walled garden
			- missing the point:
				- there going to be no killer app
				- the reall killer app is the one that is going to be the one that reasons over the aggragtion of all this data
					- there are already players
						- personal cloud.com. spark, cosm, owncloud
				- must have a discovery service, must have a single cloud
- it takes time to change technology
	- 10 years to go
	- the proprietary internet system were the best at the beginning
		- e.g. AOL
- truck ideas and road ideas
	- 
	- maclcolm mcclean
		- invented container shipping
			- made it 26 times cheaper to do shipping
			- but he gave away his idea t the maritime ISO
			- the power of open standards
	- s easy to be blinded by the giants of today
		- all the ideas are still important
		- we are going to see the AOL of internet things
			- but then the open standards will triumph

## hack yourself first

- troy hunt @troyhunt
- wearing bobby tables
- does pluralshight training, giving away some coupons

### break your own applications

- before someone else does
- go on the cyber-offence
- learn how to do a bunch of common hacks

### set the bar low - how dumb are we being on the web

### credit card

- expectations from online credit card processes
- but!
	- people posts pictures of their new credit cards on twitter

### server config

- inurl:ftp inurl:web.config filetype:config
	- find asp.NET web configs exposed
		- these contain database settings, etc
		- remove the file name, and you geta  directory listing
	- 5530 results

### now some real attacks

- sql injection
- understand that a URL is translated into an SQL statement
	http://abc.com/products?id=3
	http://abc.com/products?id=3
	http://abc.com/products?id=3;drop table products
	- tweeted a link where his 3yo kid does sql injection
	- havij -  free tool from itsecteam.com
		- sql injecton tool, error based
			- if the error discloses some error about the database, then we use that
		- automates the level of hacking
	- there are more advanced techniques like boolean based attacks

### mobile

- can you trust you mobile devices
- can you trust your apps
- connect to API that disckises every users' password
- even banks do serious things like turning off SSL certificate validation

### using fiddler

- set the wifi proxy to your PC, and port to 8888
	- then enable HTTP proxy oj port 8888 on your server
	- will capture all the traffic on the site
	- then run the app
		- british airways executive app
	- in a browser everything is available easily
		- but in a mobile app, make sure you use fiddler to make this available

### man in the middle

- big problem with SSL
- how are we geeting SSL wrong?
	- life cycle of a HTTP request
		- "doesn't really happne" - yes it does
		- device makes a reuest to the wifi modem
		- goes over the wires
		- trhough an ISP
		- ends up in a legitimate server (and in the NSA)
		- response just does the same in reverse
	- in TLS
		- each one of those point is a risk
		- any unprotected traffic is interceptable at those points
		- even when thr epage is HTTP, but logins are posted to HTTPS
		- same thing with using iframes
	- use fiddler as the MITM
		- use on response befroe response event
		- inserta keylogger into it
		- this can happen anywhere, at any of those points
- wifi pineapple
	- buy one for 100$
	- use it to route internet traffic through your own PC
	- use them to send probe requests
		- all the SID names
	- it can then change its SSID to one of them
		- and then it will automatically connect to them
		- this is only a problem, when the apllication does not properly protect the transport layer
		- very easy to hijack someone's traffic

### hash

- use a hash for password storage
	- one way deterministic algorithm
		- can never be unhashed
		- the same text into the same hashing algorithm is always the same
			- the problem is that because it is deterministic, so uyou can build rainbow tables
- so you add salt
	- per user salt
		- hash(password + salt) = cipher
- this can be cracked still
	- hashcat
		- uses GPU accelration
	- only needs a password dictionary and the hashes and salts
	- the fundanmental problem is that password hashing is too pfast
		- bcrypt, pbkdf2 etc address this problem by making hashes intentionally slower
		- sha1 etc is just too slow

### devices

- alot of insecure ones, because they are trying to push them out quickly
- e.g.
	- hapifork
	- satis toilets

!!! asm
	- optimise using || 0 for ints and + for floats

## ES6 - js improved

- axel rauschemeyer

### terms

- TC39
	- committee evolving JS
	- memeber are companies, and they send peole to attend meeting
- ECMAscript
	- the standard name
	- javascript copyright is owned by mozilla and sun/ oracle
	- js is just the colloquial name
	- harmony: refers to ES6 & ES7

### goals

- make JS better
	- for more complex applications
	- for libaries and DOM
	- as a target for code generators, and transpilation

### how arefeatures designed

- avoids design by committe
	- instead designed by champions
		- the less people involved in design, the better it is, usually
		- have one person in charge
		- and they get feedback from the rest of TC39 and the rest of the committee
			- including field testing in browsers
		- TC39 has the final word

### how to upgrade a web language?

- challenges when it makes a clear cut from the past
	- when you add new features, it is a forced upgrade
	- but with JS, it is challenging, because you cannot break existing code
	- therefore ES6 only adds new features
- it will also take really long for ES6 to be widely supported
	- need to tanspile

### variables and scoping

- ES5: only function scoping
	- everyting you declare is the scope of the inntermost enclosing function
	- ES6: use let keyword - no need to IIFIs

### destrcturing objects

- extract data
	- more compact code in extracting properties from an object
- arrays
	- ...rest
	- swap in place
- refutable by default
	- refutable, irrefutable, and defautl values when extracts value from an object

### functions

- arrow functions
	- less verbose syntax for function declaration
	- don't need to do `var self= this;` (shadowing of the this keword in inner functions)
	    - with arrow function this is no longer a problem - this remain the same throughout
- parameter handling
    - currently cumbersome, and arguments object is necessary fro anything that is complex
    - allow default values to be specified when missijing
    - use ...others to get remaingin arguments in an array
- spread operator
	- obviates the need for Function#apply
	- expands an array into a param list
- named parameters
	- you can specify parametres as objects in the paraeter liste
	- no true names params - but you don't really need it


### object literals

- double underscore is pronouned "dunder"
	- no need to use the function when defining objects as classes
	- dunder proto
- shorthand for when you want to return a tuple

### symbols

- very similar to strings
	- main advatage is that is prevents clashes
	- computed property key: property name is surround by square brackets

### classes

- what we ave right now it is not too bad
	- so these are not too importnat
		- but things do get hairy when you want to do inheritance - you need libraries
		- and very good for portability, becaundse everyone does their own thing in their library
		- intimidating for beginners
- introduces the extends, super, static,  and constructor keywords

### modules

- while we have 2 competing module systems:
	- AMD - requireJS
	- commonJS - node, browserify
- need extra compilationstep, and fractures the ecosystem
- intoruces new keywords: import, export
- based on file systems

### templates

- template strings allow you to do easy inline string substitution
	- comes with syntactic sugar
- new syntax for strings is that you can define a string across multiple lines, if prefixed with the keyword raw
- regex
	- XRegExp library
	- use backticks insead of strings

### stabdard library

- currently very spartan
	- underscorejs fills the hole in this library
- now
	- maps, sets
	- string repeeat, startsWith, endsWith

### loops and iteration

- iteration syntax easier
- can implement your own custom iterators
- for in has its problems, this fixes that

### time table

- finaldraft in nov 2013
- july 2014 editorially complete
- dec 2014, approval by ECMAscript
- but features already turned out in browsers
	- cannot support on all browsers, so find transpilers to ES5
		- typescript
			- ES6 + type annotations at development time
		- traceur
			- google
		- !!! what is the facebook one?
		- es6-shim
			- shim - only the new standard library functions
	- but you need to enable sources maps in order to debug this
- will have complete support byt he end of 2014, but you canuse it already today thanks to transpilers today
- biggest impact is the unification of the community
	- due to standardising o classes and modules

## current state of HTML5

- @cliener
- wufoo.com/ html5
- evolt.org/node/36435

### recap

- input types
	- email
	- tel
	- just changes the keyboard that pops up
	- don't use
		- datetime - w3c has marked it as in danger of support being dropped
- required
- placeholder
- pattern
	- regex
	- some times can bring up custom keyboards
	- can form powerful matches

## web components

- mark dalgliesh
- seek, melbjs

### 

- one of the biggest changes to HTML5 in 15 minutes
- you are already an expert because you are familiar with elements
- components today
	- you have to bring in a stylesheet
	- you have to bring in a js
	- create a placeholder DOM elements
	- window.load, run script
	- BUT
		- this doesn't tie into the lifecycle of a native DOM element
		- the extra dom elements inserted by this do not have their own namespace - this is a core problem
- web compenents
	- single import, and just add it to your DOM
	- encapsulates all of its functionality
	- you can only see its innards using a #document-fragment
		- gerat for widget developer
		- only when you turn on shadow DOM
- wut
	- custom elements
	- shadow dom
	- tmeplate element
	- html imports
	- css decorators
- dom elements
	- acess to things that browser vendors have been doing for a long time
		- you are already and expert
	- 
		- instantiated with markup
		- can also bre instantiated with markup
		- these elements are instances
			- instanceof
			- prototype
		- can perform their own intiialisation
a new custom ele
		- elements can resond to attribute changes
		- can have hidden internal DOM structures
			- e.g. HTML5 date input selector
		- element can have access to child elements
		- can have their own private styles
		- can provide style hooks to their internals
- custom elements
	- learnign some new api
	- register 
		vat MyElem = document.register
	- can be instantiated with markup OR js
	- elements can perform their own initialisation
	- attributeCHangedCallBack
	- createdCallbcack
		var shadow = this.createShadowRoot();
		shadow.innerHTML = "...";
	- select="i"
	- styles are scoped int he context
	- part to provide style hooks
- 
	- simple
	- consistent
	- reusable
		- can be dropped in and out of projects, sandboxed
	- encapsulated
		- conceptual boundary between itself and the DOM it has been inseretd into
	- composable
		- can nest custom elements within each other
		- probaly see talks in a couple of years about how to write your own framework with it
-
	chtome://flags
		experimental frameworks
	- poly fills
		- polymer
		- x-tag
	- cop,ponents
		- polymer elements
		- brick
		- x-tag registry
	- fire up the console and experiment

## responsive imagery

- simon elvery @drzax

###

- the display and functionality of a website shoudl self-optimised fr the best performance for the features of the device
	- not that not just the resolution	
- halfway house
	- meta queries etc, make resposive web design quite good
- 3 things for ideal
	- automatic image selection
		- browser should be automatically select the right image
			- using  few ifferent metrics
				- resolution, pxel density
		- media type
			- screen or print
		- quality and the speed of the connection
	- specifying sources
		- specify 'breakpoints'
			- conditions under which an image is suitable for display
			- using the same synatx as for media queries
		- make sure that relative units are possible
		- art direct the output
			- ?
	- the user should have ultimate control
		- be able to specify a default font size
		- be able to specify that I want the low res version
			- e.g. mobile data is fast but too expensive
- RICG
	- 2 longstanding solutions
		- <picture>
		- <img> sourceset
- responding to the unknown
	- choose yout own adventure approachk
	- art direction
		- crop to centre is not art direction
		- specifying cropping rukes
- slides available on his twitter/ github

## I yield for generators

- adam ahmed @typesthings

### what are generators?

- functions that have multiple return  end points
	- you can return multiple times with the same function call
	- you can pass back multiple things betweent he caller and a generator in the ES6 impl

- collaborative functions
	- power is with what you call them wiht
	- infinite sequnces
		- lazy evaluation
	- for of loops
	- higher order generators
	- .NET & LINQ style
		- !!! An powell's blog post on this
	- pyramid of doom
		- make it read synchrnously
	- promises-like then
	- auto batching
	- go-style co-routines in js by david nolan
		- nice efficient way to pipieline things
	- haskell point free notations
- when
	- chrome enable javscript harmondy
	- node 0.11.x
	- firefox aurora

## js beyond the webpage

- patrick catanzariti @that patrickguy

### devices

- may 1995
	- netscape developed mocha --> livescript --> javascript
	- js with a dialog box and you could update the page
	- AJAX
	- jQuery
	- nodejs
- js has escaped the web
	- devices love the web
	- internet of things
	- ninja block
		- incoke and reposnd to devices IRL using js
		- 433MHz and USB devices
		- http://ninjablocks.com
	- tessel
		- not available yet - tessel.io 
		- microprocessor that runs JS
		- add it to a device to invoke and respond via JS
	- ardhuino
		- - do it from scratch
		-JS frameworks for them
	- wearscript
		- code apps an shared in an open ecosystem
		- runs on google glass
		- availabel already if you have google glass
	- leap motion
		- sense hand motions
		- javascript API
		- http:// leapmotion.com
		- in dick smith
	- onyx
		- respond to events on your android devicce via JS
		- launch app, change volumen, etc
		- http://onx.ms
	- xme
		- personal assistant program
		- hybrid betwen onX and google now
		- used for void recoginition API
		- app.xndme.com
- demo time
	- set up a node server with expressJS
	- include ninjalocks (require)
	- set up a route
		- in the route, call ninjablock API
	- added twitter streams API
		- blue and red in his API
- slide switcher
	- send s request from onyx
	- uses socket.io
	- moves slides in the direction of the lfick of the phone

## the Z dimension

- glen maddern
- wrote the web directiosn website

### talks about browsers

- how does depth work
- browsers paint
	- the painters algorithm
	- if you want something to be infront fo something else, you paint that later
	- but it paints everything independently
	- there os no depth, only order
- protip
	- box-shadow is your friends
		- use a large box shadow on hover to show which one
		- tree order! but special rules for some elements types and layout types
	- stacking contexts
		- a part of the DOM that is drawn together
		- an alement and it children are drawn together
- old options
	- just memeorise
	- and learnt he theory
	- now isntead
		- use chrome with  bunch of flags
			- you get a record button
				- CC && CC debug
				-- collected telemetry about what the browser has done
- layers
	- liek uper stacking contexts
		- a real unit, and it is rendered by itself - shipped off o the GPU by itself
	- not very clear when it will happen
	- use translateX instead of right for animation
	    - it will actually pop the layer up during the animation, and then puts it back down again
    - use translate3d(0,0,0)
    	- it will create extra layer from the get-go
- don't use the very bottom element as its own element
	- because all the things in it will themselves get their own layer
	- expensive
- protups
	- hpover boxshadow
	- chrome tracing
	- layers panel
- geelen.github.io/the-z-dimension
