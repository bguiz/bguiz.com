## Components

- define componnents
- web components spec

### AngularJs components

- building a DSL using directives
- no special syntax for components
- just use directives and isolate their scope
- syntax of a scope isolated, element restricted directive
- relation to web components spec

### EmberJs components

- syntax of Ember.Component
- learning curve
- relation to web components spec

- What is the syntax used to express a component?
- What level of abstraction do these components sit at?
- How well do these components align with the current draft sepcification for web components?

## Discussion

- Link to MVC
- MVC + templates + routing + components cover all the fundamental or "compulsory parts"/ "core competency" of a SPA framework
	- Thus these are the most important
- The remainder of the posts compare these frameworks or higher order differentiating factors
	- These are important too
	- But basics come first - hierarchy of needs
