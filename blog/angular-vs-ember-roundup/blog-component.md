## Components

- define componnents
- web components spec

### AngularJs components

[creating components with AngularJs](http://blog.ijasoneverett.com/2013/03/creating-components-with-angular-js/)

[choose your own adventure](https://github.com/danielstern/cyo)

[Mi≈°ko Hevery on plans tomake web compnents work seamlessly with AngularJs directives](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/polymer-dev/4RSYaKmbtEk/uYnY3900wpIJ)

[Web components draft spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/)

- building a DSL using directives
- no special syntax for components
- just use directives and isolate their scope
- syntax of a scope isolated, element restricted directive
- relation to web components spec

### EmberJs components

[Using EmberJs components](http://emberjs.com/guides/components/passing-properties-to-a-component/)

[Yehuda Katz on plans for Web Components in EmberJs](https://gist.github.com/wycats/9144666b0c606d1838be)

- syntax of Ember.Component
- learning curve
- relation to web components spec

- What is the syntax used to express a component?
- What level of abstraction do these components sit at?
- How well do these components align with the current draft sepcification for web components?

## Discussion

- Link to MVC
- MVC + templates + routing + components cover all the fundamental or "compulsory parts"/ "core competency" of a SPA framework
	- Thus these are the most important
- The remainder of the posts compare these frameworks or higher order differentiating factors
	- These are important too
	- But basics come first - hierarchy of needs
