While developing apps using BackboneJs, I have been itching to use a newer Javascript single-page application framework.
If at least to find out if the tried-and-tested, battle proven, but often verbose and feature lacking BackboneJs is indeed worth continuing developing with.

I had wanted to compare BackboneJs to AngularJs, EmberJs, and ReactJs.
Unfortunately, I was spreading myself too thin in doing all three, and ran out of time and. 
So I picked AngularJs and EmberJs. These two are the second and third most popular front end Javascript frameworks, after BackboneJs, and are used (mostly) to build single page applications.

Interestingly, they have very different philosophies on how code should be structured, and even on how much structure there should be. 
This is going to be a be an interesting comparison, so stay tuned!
