## Routing

- What is the syntax used to express a router?
- Does the router support a flat or hierarchical series of routes?
- What additional libraries do you need to use the router?

## Components

- What is the syntax used to express a component?
- What level of abstraction do these components sit at?
- How well do these components align with the current draft sepcification for web components?

## Discussion

- Link to MVC
- MVC + templates + routing + components cover all the fundamental or "compulsory parts"/ "core competency" of a SPA framework
	- Thus these are the most important
- The remainder of the posts compare these frameworks or higher order differentiating factors
	- These are important too
	- But basics come first - hierarchy of needs
