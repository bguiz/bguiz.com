I would like to kick off this series of posts where we compare AngularJs to EmberJs by stating what exactly we will be comparing.

The space that these two operate in - Javascript frameworks used to develop single-page applications - is a rather complex one.
Not only is it highly complex because of the number of different issues, concepts, and even philosophies, that these thigs touch;
it is also a moving target, because they are a fairly new new thing, and still going through the initial stages of rapid development.

Thus the only certainty here is that there is no definitive answer.
We shall try, nonetheless.

## Why criteria are necessary

Without facts, opinions will have their day in the park.
We want to make this as non-subjective as possible.

Also, it helps you the reader, know if this series of posts is going to be worth your time reading.
If - and I know this is a silly example - whether the chipmunk or the shield with the "A" is the better logo is very important to you, and you want to choose your framework based on that;
then these posts are not for you, as you do not see this being listed as one of the criteria below.

That being said, if I have missed something out below, and you think it would benefit the discussion, [let me know](https://twitter.com/bguiz).
