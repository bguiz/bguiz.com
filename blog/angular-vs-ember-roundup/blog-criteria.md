I would like to kick off this series of posts where we compare AngularJs to EmberJs by stating what exactly we will be comparing.

The space that these two operate in - Javascript frameworks used to develop single-page applications - is a rather complex one.
Not only is it highly complex because of the number of different issues, concepts, and even philosophies, that these thigs touch;
it is also a moving target, because they are a fairly new new thing, and still going through the initial stages of rapid development.

Thus the only certainty here is that there is no definitive answer.
We shall try, nonetheless.

## Why criteria are necessary

Without facts, opinions will have their day in the park.
We want to make this as non-subjective as possible.

Also, it helps you the reader, know if this series of posts is going to be worth your time reading.
If - and I know this is a silly example - whether the chipmunk or the shield with the "A" is the better logo is very important to you, and you want to choose your framework based on that;
then these posts are not for you, as you do not see this being listed as one of the criteria below.

That being said, if I have missed something out below, and you think it would benefit the discussion, [let me know](https://twitter.com/bguiz).

## What the criteria are

- Learning curve
- Models
- Views
- Controllers
- Router
- Templating
- Components
- Dependency management
- Build tooling
- Opinionation
- Development tooling
- Dependencies
- Community
- Track record
- Contributions
- Maturity
- Level of abstraction/ structure
- Testability

There we have it, all the criteria that this series of posts will cover!

## A note of fairness and polarisation

Which one is better at what?

One framework is is going to better than the other on some of the criteria, and the other way around on the others.

It is worth pointing out here that this a fairly polarised topic, 
with the communities of developers using each of these frameworks, 
firmly believing that their framework of choice is the best thing since sliced bread 
(or at least **way better** than the other).

Thus I feel that it is necessary to do a little bit of a disclaimer here, 
and state that I belong to neither camp.
I have worked with jQuery mobile, BB10 webworks, and BackboneJs before;
and prior to this I have been keeping abreast with both AngularJs and EmberJs,
but have not developed anything serious - nothing more complex than [a Todo app](http://todomvc.com) - before.

tl;dr = I am going to be fair and unbiased.

## Let&apos;s begin!
