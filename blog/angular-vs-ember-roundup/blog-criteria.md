I would like to kick off this series of posts where we compare AngularJs to EmberJs by stating what exactly we will be comparing.

The space that these two operate in - Javascript frameworks used to develop single-page applications - is a rather complex one.
Not only is it highly complex because of the number of different issues, concepts, and even philosophies, that these thigs touch;
it is also a moving target, because they are a fairly new new thing, and still going through the initial stages of rapid development.

Thus the only certainty here is that there is no definitive answer.
We shall try, nonetheless.
