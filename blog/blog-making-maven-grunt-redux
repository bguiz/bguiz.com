Recently, I needed to make a single-page web app that would be served by a Java backend.
That would be as simple as copying the static files into the relevant folder, right?
Well, as it turns out, not quite so simple,
as each project uses a different build system.

Single-page web apps are typically built using the Grunt and Bower toolchain,
which are NodeJs scripts.
Java web apps are typically built using either the Ant or Maven toolchains.

## Pick one, or make a bridge?

So, should we replace the build tool of with the build tool of the other,
or should we just make one of themtalk to the other?
Addy Osmani has an article, [Making Maven Grunt](http://addyosmani.com/blog/making-maven-grunt/),
whichdescribes this situation quite succinctly:

"More times than not, it's the back-end team who will define the build process and end up having to wrangle your front-end code into there."

"Whilst there are many plugin options for JavaScript processing in the Maven world, these plugins can be a real chore to create, maintain and update. In addition, they often have outdated dependencies – meaning you need to monkey-patch them to work and developers – especially those not coming from a Java background – dislike it."

Thus it appears that in order to get the best of both worlds,
the best option would be to create the bridge that allows one build system to talk to the other.

## The options


Turns out that this is a problem that several have had, and solved, before.

- [yeoman-maven-plugin](https://github.com/trecloux/yeoman-maven-plugin)
- maven-antrun-plugin
- exec-maven-plugin

If you your web app is generated by [yeoman](http://yeoman.io),
then the `yeoman-maven-plugin` provides some sensible configuration that work out of the box.
However, if you need something a little more flexible,
the `maven-antrun-plugin`, or the `exec-maven-plugin` your best bet.

However, I did not want to throw Ant into the mix, 
as I was already using two other build systems and their syntaxes - 
and thus reluctant to throw a third into the mix;
`exec-maven-plugin` it was!
