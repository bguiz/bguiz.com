Recently, I needed to make a single-page web app that would be served by a Java backend.
That would be as simple as copying the static files into the relevant folder, right?
Well, as it turns out, not quite so simple,
as each project uses a different build system.

Single-page web apps are typically built using the Grunt and Bower toolchain,
which are NodeJs scripts.
Java web apps are typically built using either the Ant or Maven toolchains.
