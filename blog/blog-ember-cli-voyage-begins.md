[Stefan Penner](https://twitter.com/stefanpenner)
converted Ember App Kit to [ember-cli](http://iamstef.net/ember-cli/)
about a month ago, and its feature list is pretty amazing,
and I thought that it was about time to give it a whir.

When developing on beta, bleeding edge, software libraries;
and when beginning to use a completely new tool chain -
in this case I was switching from
[GruntJs](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt)
to [BroccoliJs](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli);
however, ones tends to run into quite a few walls!

Here are all the questions I have asked on Stackoverflow,
and issues/ requests/ pull requests I have created on Github,
in the past couple of days:
