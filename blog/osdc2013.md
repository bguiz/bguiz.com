#OSDC

## confernece notes

- there should be a conference wifi
- there should be power sockets at each table for laptops
- conference venue with split rooms - not soundproof, can hear adjacent rooms thourgh walls
- namecards refill
- projector should support a higher resolution (800x600 full, 1024x768 cropped)
- keep track of speakers - had a no show for one of them, and organisers weren't aware
- create a lanyrd profile

## Cherie Ellis

- organiser IC
- all presenters to make a PDF backup of their presentation
- keep an eye out for the brids of feather events tomorrow evening

### biz meets opesource

- more bugs and security issues have been eyeballed and 
- manage the contribution of multiple developers
- but people need to get paid
- so how?

- silverstripe CMS has been open sourced
- the relationship between biz and open source has been tense

### so

- why do this?
	1. Why would a biz want to open source their product?
		- found that they were losing a lot of potential customers (developers) because the initial licence fee was prohibitive
		- reasons
			- your market expects it.
				- you cannot change the market unles you already are the market leader. especially when it comes to expectation of what should be free and what shouldn't
			- the web is built on open source software
			- gains market share a lot more quickly
			- passionate users
				- the community is much more engaged
				- developers love working on open source projects more than they do regular projects
				- they will sell it for you
				- if passion is high enough, you get contributors
	2. Why would an open source project want to build a biz around their project?
		- example company stories
			- redhat
				- found an existing open source project and decided to build a project around it
				- started off wanting to build app dev tools, and out of frustration with linux, pivoted and decided to build his own distro
				- started off selling physical discs, and then went on to selling contracts, training, and certification
				- RHEL launched - you had to pay for the binary distribution, with included support contracts
				- larger companies are willing to pay money for certainty and stability
			- mySQL AB
				- until 2008 it was an independent open source company
				- 1 billion exit
				- same as redhat, but they dual licenced
			- acquia
				- much newer compamny (founded 2007)
				- product and services around the drupal CMS
				- he was one of the original writers of drupal
				- same style - freemium
				- difference: they have platform-as-a-service and software-as-a-service offerings
					- now even redhat is also doing this
					- PaaS came after SaaS (instead of offering a complete product)
			- heroku
				- first to ofer PaaS
				- initial success very tied to the popularity of Ruby and RoR
			- 37signals
				- most of the opriginal developers of RoR
					- still work on the project on company time
			- silverstripe
				- hobby
				- found it hard to find the time to develop the software 
					- billable hours
				- wasn't enough connection between community growth and biz growth
					- in a biz, ou have limited resources
					- kill 2 birds with one stone - what's good for biz and waht;'s good for the open surce software
				- cause of many internal debates
				- their CMS offering is their flagship offering
					- now have more leverag in selling other software
		- there is a complex symbiosis between the opensource projects and the 
			- many of the original developer so the open source project are employed by the biz's created around it
- what are other companies doing?
- silverstripe's story
- lessons learned
	- DIY vs Infrastructure
	- WHat help would people need to be successful with a projetc? - that's what a good offering is
	- Caution against targeting a market  that always goes for free
		- Go for a market that would be willing to pay more for premium services
		- Usually this means larger companies
	- biz is hard, and will pull focus away from the original open source project
		- don't thinkt hat that you be allowed to spend most of your time developing your open source project
		- it is hard to get people to part with money, and bend over backwards for the first few
		- that is why a sales team is needed (writing the code is the easy part)
	- stay competitive
		- you might get competition from companies
		- get support for the project to be done by the developer sof the project
			- do not have separate support and developement teams
	- work with your community
		- as important as our own staff
	- pick the right kind of product
		- where the users of the system can also contribute to the 
		- consumer focussed ones can also succeed, but are a lot more difficult
			- must have a "sugar dady" company
	- bridge the gap between DIY and infrastructure
- questions
	- when you sell custome developed plugins or extensions, how do you convince the client that that should be open sourced?
		- the easiest way is to tell them that that can indeed be done, but they have to be responsible for the ongoing maintenence of it, which means more money
		- be careful about covering yourself legally
	- how do you deploy your code, if it is a scripting language?
		- is that a contributor to the decision to open source?
		- not as hard as js, where it is sent to every single customer!
		- people get concerned with escrow (what happnes if your go out of biz)
		- some guy is talking about navitech's ticketing system, where it was obfuscated PERL
		- buying some software, but not getting the source code, is a disadvantage
	- convincing the NZ govt to standardize on a single CMS, does that save tax payers' money?
		- not it isn't actually mandatory, it is a case of providing the default
		- how can we create a system that uses it because they have to, but because they want to
	- PHP? Is there a resistance to change?

##

- assistant privacy commissioner of NZ
- a lawyer
- privacy s currently a bit of a hot topic
- do not leave privacy to the lawyers 
	- the legal check did not work, develpers need to be aware of privacy themselves
- PBD: privacy by design
	- Privacy
		- not about keeping things secret, but about giving end users control over what information they expose
		- only give the info that you need
		- get it from the person directly
		- tell them what you are doing (be open)
		- don't be sneaky
		- keep information reasonably secure
		- make sure that people can access what information you have about themselves, and correct it if it is wrong, and set visibility of them
		- only keep data for as long as you need it
		- use it only for what users have consented for it for.
		- unique identifiers - identifiable people
	- Build:
		- proactive, not reactive. design privacy in from the start
			- need to have the conversations with the clients
		- avoid obvious privacy design flaws
		- make privacy the default setting (opt out of privacy)
### Q

- what has NZ done to ensure that something like the NSA doesn't happen here?
- nobody reads terms and conditions. how is that adressed?

## Secure Medical API

Scott Penrose

### Medical

- Who?
	- GPs
	- PCEHRs
		- Personal control electronic health records
		- Centralise government 
	- Others
- US standards
	- helath insurance portability and acountability act
	- not sure if this is applicable to data
- AUstralian standards
	- there are legal standards, but no technical standards
- Storage
	- encrypted disk; because hard didsks are backed up,a nd they will be disposed
		- only mounted decrypted
	- required to destory data after a certain time out
- COmponents
	- authentication
	- user interface
	- API
		- data storag, jQuery UI, touchPunch, jQueryREST, Raphael & Morris (grpahs), Amplify (Events, pubsub)
		- calculations
- authentication
	- SSL client certificates
		- most people don't know about this anyway
	- what we have to do
		- HTTPS (server SSL certificates) and cookies
- User interface
	- historically: ExtJS
	- proposal: sencha touch
	- actual: jQuery + plugins
		- with HTML5 specs, ist is quite reasonable to write everything by hand, using HTML5, JS, and CSS3
		- very thin framework layer, provided by jQuery
			- jQuery
	- future considerations: AngularJS, KnockoutJS
- API
	- REST + JSON
- One or many?
	- About 10-12 queries per page
		- problem with multiple
	- Try to get the data all in one go
		- libraries to do this, such as ExtDirect
		- Manual systems
			- Rolled their own "sets" of data
			- Work in Progress
			- facing a problem with having to get the backend developers needing to change the code every time
- Standards
	- SMART http://smartplatforms.org
		- still building a centralised platform
		- all data lives in a single server
	- custom integrators
		- (commerical) this is the most common
		- two GPs wnat to connect their systems together
			- they call them shared health standards
		- many to many implementations, so there is a huge mess of things
	- PCEHR - personal controlled E-Health Record
		- sends that data to the government
		- looking at it from a provider's perspective
			- what if you wish to give it to your family members? there is currently no way to do this.
	- standardisation of vocabulary
		- not there yet: naming conventions, many coversions are necessary
- REST
	- HATEOS
		- ensure that everything is referentially linked to
		- cool because we can navigate from one JSON to another within the browser
- TOols
	- swagger
		- open source project
		- a way of documenting REST
			- kinda like WSDL is to SOAP
		- a way to hand over to developers a full description of the API
	- SIF REST sandboxit works, 
- code split
	- becomes important to be able to split code
	- parts
		- authentication
		- data API (no biz rules)
		- calculate API (where the biz rules are implemented)
			- this part can be open sourced, thus it is releasable
- PERL dancer
	- prefer to come back to PERL
	- dead simple, flexible, and has REST out of the box
- API testing
	- black box testing
	- do not write it yourself, perhaps someone devious
		- you will always est how you know that 
- jQuery REST
	- looks like a really easy way to interact with a RESTful API
- Installation
	- git
		- with separate packages
		- use tags whenever anything is done
			- replayability
	- make install LOCAL=X
		- database LOCAL=X
- lockability
	- add lock to a particular patient
		- in this case it is a "sub" login
- user authentication
	- multi authentication
		- using SMS, whenever they log in from a new device
- protection stages
	- server, data, storage
		- apache mod_security, mod_evasive, authN & authNZ
		- dancer pre-hooks
		- dno NOT do authentication intheir application, do it in the lower level instead
	- users doing silly things
- conclusion
	- encrypted records - a long way off
	- security laers
	- user multi factor auth

## REST in a Snap(let)

- Building Web Resources in Haskell
- Timothy Jones
	- phd student in victoria U, wellington
	- github.com/zimothy
	- maintainer of coffeescript
	- develops using nodejs and express (started off using classic ASP)
		- likes express routes
		- but ran into a very diffuclt problem debugging because types were not enforced

### 

- How bad php is in enforcing invariants
	- haskell types can enforce them
	- immutable state
- intro to web framework programming using haskell
	- very 
- why haskell
	- ain't no java type system
		- not as focussed on enforcing constraints as haskel
	- steep learning curve figuring out it type errors
		- but you learn to love it
	- compiled to native code
		- very fast, almost as fast as C
	- scales wel, becuase we can take advtange of concurrency due to immutable state
	- open source
		- huge repository on hackage
	- got really tired of pyramids of doom
		- callback spaghetti
		- in haskeel you cN WRITE CODE SYNCHRONOUSLY
		- promises already in haskell through monads
- haskell on the web
	- quick and easy vs. really involved
	- snap framework is the middle ground

		import Snap
		quickHtppServe (writeText "Hello WOrld")

	- for bigger projects

		> snap init

	- has hot redevelopment in dev mode
		- compile time programming trick
		- rebuild just the bits of the server necessary upon the next request
- snap routing
	- routers are data structures
	- the result of the route i an object, which you can later do other things with
	- easily composed with each other
- snaplets
	- doesn't come with a kitchen sink
	- compose additional functionality using snaplets (components)

		data MySite = MySite {
			heist :: Snaplet Hesit,
			db :: Snaplet Sqlite
		}

	- MySite is a snaplet too!

- CRUD
	- doesn't have proper support for building a RESTful API
	- has built ownlibrary
	- CRUD: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
	- COntent negotiation: accept: application/json
	- HATEOAS: puts in the hypermedia link to the linked resources
- snaplet-rest
	- make sure tht it is easy to get it up and running as soon as possible
	- use a CRUD model to produce a REST model (declarative)
	- doing the right thing should be easy (and the default)
- user resource
	- deriveJSON ^^User
		- this is because Haskell has no reflection, and so the compiler needs to work this out
		- from template haskell

		github.com/zimothy/snaplet-rest
		cabal update
		cabal install snaplet-rets

## Raphael

- Maurice Manesch
- http://redwaratah.com, click on recent updates

### Goal

- Wargaming (on boards), a 70's game called PRESTAG
- Used alot of PHP, AJAX, jQuery, mySQL, but focus is on the graphics

### Warning

- This presentation may contain traces of trigonometry

### Samples

- CHeck out dimitriy's samples page on the raphael page

### Layers

- Grpahics have layers
	- important to manage them
- Tell andrew hamilton about this

### Making a game board

- hexagonal board
	- simple SVG code
	- lots of hexagons accomplished using wiggly lines
- "We can always count on the American's to do the right thing, after they have exhausted all the other possiblities" - Winston Churchill

### SVG drawing

- libreOffice can export to SVG
- just open up the file in a text editor, and copy it into raphael

### positioning

- Raphael manages drag and drop really easily
	- can rag objects aound as sets
- rotation: just draw objects facing up, and then invoke raphael to rotatae it around a point

- http://datavisualization.ch
- D3.js
- jsplumb
- the problem with raphael is that your astuck with a canvas. you cannot draw across the webpage between any elements.

## Roll your own GIS system from FOSS components

- Brent Wood
- Program leader at NIWA (govt agency)
	- NIWA is FOSS freindly
	- Founding member of OSGeo

### open data, open standards

- pretty much all environmental data sets have spatial infomration
- however, lots of technologies/ tools do not support spatial information

### what is GIS?

- Geographic Inorfmation Systen
- FUnctionality:
	- sptail data capture, management, and a lot of other functions
- DB
	- spatially aware/ enabled databases for database management
		- compliant with OGC SFS and/or ANSI SQL/MM3
	- favourite: PostGIS (postgres addon)
	- mariaDB, mySQL
	- spatiaLite
	- common libs: proj 5, GDAL, CEOS
- Proprietary tools failed in hurricane recovery
	- FOSS system was built in 4 days that did the job
	- problem was vendor lock in - interoparbility was simply not there (standards weren't adhered to)

- FOSS gets rejected
	- but a solution created using the exact same FOSS tools, but with a support contract was approved
	- http://2013.foss4g.org/conf/gallery
- suite:
	- postgis
	- UMN mapserver

## Identity management

- Mark de Reeper

### what is

- being able to answer questions on identity

## AWS case study

- Catalyst

### Australia's premier MOOC

- open2study
- created by open universities - and it is free. launched april 2013
- all free, 30+  high quality courses (with a multi million dollar project)
-  simpleSAMLphp + moodle + drupal
- used agile
	- sometimes there are challenges around clients who do not necessarily understand agile
	- aguile works best when it is driven by the clients themselves

###

- Dec 2012 - Apr 2013: 6 full time devs
- Client wanted AWS, and AWS had just opened a data centre in Sydney
- Catalyst had never done a system of this size beore

### AWS impressions

- the more you use it the more you love it
- flexibility and speed with which you can spin up and spin down servers really quickly
- rate of feature development is really quick
- when used properly, it is very cheap compared to aussie servers

criticisms

- non-guaranteed write to disk (provisioned IOPs)
	- but that has since been added (but it costs a lot)

### architecting for failure

- must do this in any enterprise situation
- with IaaS, it is cattle not pets
	- you cannot touch them physically, you have no relationship with them - you just replace them
	- e.g. app servers that scale based on custom defined rules (front end servers in auto scale groups)
	- AWS solutions architects are very helpful resource
		- proactive and collaborative around helping clients to do their work, and they generally give good advice

### clustered fle systems

- Not networksed file storage
	- AWS doesn't allow this - because it is a single point of failure
	- don't use OCFS2
- Use ClusterFS instead
	- doesn't handle small files that change alot very well
		- because reprition can generate race conditions
		- so don't store session file here
	- has cryptic failure conditions
	- S3 is not suitable for site data

### AWS architecture policy

- aimed toward stateless worker bees
- can make snapshots of an EC2 isntance
- one of the biggest problems with AWS is just undersyand what all the offerings are, wat the lock ins are, what the alternatives are, etc.
- use AWS services where possible
- automate proesses where possible
- be on the lookout for better ways

- opsworks

### front end pilic

- deploy an admin instance
	- matches the spec
	- code gets uploaded here
- push code onto this machine
- load python script
	- uses AWS api
	- snapshots this admin instance
	- rolls these into multiple instance in the autoscale instance groups
	- spins down the existing instances in the autoscale group
	- autoscale group instances are all completely stateless
		- stateful servers never get cleared

### deployment

- don't deploy anything including code config to live servers
- start using puppet (of chef or capistrano)

### load testing in AWS

- cannot do load testing otherwise AWS will shut it down
	- must be careful
	- bees with machine guns
		- can use as a DOS servcie
		- replaced the machine guns with "journeys" mutlimech
		- a distributed mechanise implementation
		- was very configurable, and had great visibility and reporting

### scalability victories

- tell apache not to look for .htacces on glusterFS
- web service optimisetion between apps
- moving bits into memcached
- quick load testing feedback
	- toyed with the idea of doing one upon each jenkins build

### SQS - simple queue system

- meroMQ and rabbitMQ are alternatives
- queue for
	- load tolerance
	- systems integration

### RDS

- not just mySQL
- log acess was challenging (now fixed)
- chachin was not enabled by default
- monitroing disk usage caught out
	- you actually should
	- the binary log was filling up because soemthing crashed
	- didn't think it needed to be monitored because it was a service, but now know should have
	- put the monitoring on anEC2 instance, because it is cheaper
- multi-AZ is a must, and proved useful
- read replica easy and powerful
- RDS is expensive
- no postgres support

### AWS  monitroing

- monitor from outside AWS (because clod watch can go down)
- not 100% certain how to monitor
	- perishable nature
- AWS VPS must be monitored over a VPS
- Shoudl you monitro that something is happening?
	- How do you test that AWS is doing what it should do?

### AWS billing

- tell client to open the acount, and they throw us the keys
	- developer does not take responsibility
	- have discussion with the client around the spending
	- consultants' developement is different
	- cpmplicates discussion
- usually cheap, but some things are very expensive
	- pre-purchase using reserved instances
- interesting arhcitecture options
	- e.g. night time shut down options

### Cool stuff

- auto scaling (very hard to sale yourself)
- API stuff
	- cloudwatch metrics - can monitor anything
	- lodwatch graphs & montiroing tools, very powerful
- load testing practicalities
- opsworks/ clodFormation
- access to talented solutions architects

### Mistakes

- looking at the AWS tooolset and trying to map that to physical machien
	- this can push you in the wrong diection in tersm of architecture
- not architecting for failure
	- this needs to be in your thoguht pattern
- getting monitroing worng
- letting devs be amateur sysadmins
	- don't let them do this
- fighting against th AWS way of doing things
	- not using the available tools
	 - 
 - not talking to the AWS solutions architects
 - not getting biz support for projects

 ### Challenge

 - AWS expertise is hard to find
 	- AWS activate program
 - smart to work with AWS solutions architects wehere possible
 - must pay attention to what is happening in the ecosystem/ community
 - the more you sink into AWS, the more you lock yourself out of others
 	- architect to sepearte dev from deploy

### Privacy

- privacy concerns are real
- understand the isues and the technical factors
- some great discussion at OSDC
- make some good arguments - privacy vs secrecy
	- some of them can be very exclusively alarmist

### Should you go AWS

- try it
- arm yourself with knowledge
- understand costs
- understand change

- rackspace is a lot less in terms of feature sets
	- don't charge you for IOPs
	- can get 5 flavours of machines
		- and they tell you exactly what you are getting
		- AWS is less forthcoming with them
	- billing is simpler

### catalyst

- has offices in syd, mel, akl, chr, wel

### Q

- openstack and AWS api compatibility?
	- be careful
	- not all the feature set is the same
	- there are cloud aggregator services that have solved this problem
		- but minimum subset of systems       

## Cython cryptography

- Tom Eastman
- catalyst

### 

- did a pastebin tool
- piped STDOUT to pastebin API, an output its URL
	- url is an MD5 hash of the contents 
- how do you create a choose your own adventure game?
	- paste them in reverse
	- create a reverse directed acyclic graph
		- cannot have any cycles
	- but he really wanted cycles in his maze
		- but had to brute force it

### Cython

- python that compiles to C instea dofbeing interpreted
	- like Python, but you specify the types when celaing each variable or function parameter (a lot more efficient)
		- 300x speed up
	- can compile regular python too
		- but you can only get a 20% improvbment

### how do you get the md5sum that you want?

- add jibberish to the bottom of each page until you get the md5 sume you want

### make it faster

- hardly anyone has done multi-threaded programming in pythong
	- python is bad at multiple threading
- has a multi-processing library
	- uses multiple processes to simulate multiple threads
	- use all cores, and use no  GIL lock interference

### getting rid of jibberish

- just use whitespace characters instead of numbers or other characters

###

- who has written software that generates their blog more often than they write blog entries?
- generate the maze
- then someone scraped it, and wrote a script that generated a graphviz of the entire maze
- research in steganographic md5 collision techniques

###

- use constraints as opportunities
- use something that you want to play with as a way of learning somethng new
	- what opportiunities are there for companies to allow employees to do this
- the question to ask when emplying someone is to find out if they have created their own blogging engine
